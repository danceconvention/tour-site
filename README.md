# danceConvention.net competition tour site

Initially created for [Raw Connection Competition Tour](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1142947162412936/),
probably will be extended to other similar use cases. Provides simple point assignment system for competition 
results, leaderboard and minimalistic search.

Showcases usage of [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) and 
[Reagent](http://reagent-project.github.io/).
